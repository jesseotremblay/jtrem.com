### Hi 👋, I'm Jesse

I'm a Product Leader who was born & raised in New England and currently lives near Boston. My brother & I started hacking websites together – and getting paid too much money for them – back in the 90's. I've been hooked on creating stuff on the internet ever since. Now do my best to make great software products that improve people's lives.
