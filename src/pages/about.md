### Hi 👋, I'm Jesse

I'm a Product Leader who was born & raised in New England and currently lives near Boston. My brother & I started hacking websites together – and getting paid too much money for them – back in the 90's. I've been hooked on creating stuff on the internet ever since. Now I do my best to make great software products that improve people's lives.

### ————————

Jtrem.com is a personal website (re)launched in 2013 by Jesse Tremblay.

This version of the site was made with [Astro](https://astro.build) and deployed with [Netlify](https://netflify). I've trimmed it back to a simple static-site so that I can keep it lightweight, fast and focus on content.
