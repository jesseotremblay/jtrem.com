This page is intended to be a list of things I have going on in my personal & professional life:
1. I just had baby #2. She is cute. I am on paternity leave from [HubSpot](https://hubspot.com) for a few months. I feel lucky to have an employer that supports this level of bonding time with my family.
2. Adding on some new pages to this site, adding in micro-posts and updating the navigation. Also trying to setup automated [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) posting. I'm just rolling this out incrementally, so things might be a little jank at times.
3. There are a bunch of old blogposts from a previous CMS that I have procrastinated on porting over to this astro.build version. I like the Astro because its all static and markdown based, but it means I need to fix some past mistakes. So, I need to reformat messy html exports into .md files, and get the cross-linking right. My scripts have been failing to make this a quick transition.
4. I've also been experimenting with building AI Agents with some frameworks like [Crewai](https://crewai.com), [Hunch](https://hunch.tools), [n8n](https://n8n.io) and others...
