### Hi ðŸ‘‹, here is how I prefer to keep in touch, and why:
- Writing: [jtrem.com](https://jtrem.com) *I mainly write on this website*
- Email: [contact@jtrem.com](mailto:contact@jtrem.com) *This is an alias, but feel free to reach out. Would love to hear from you.*
- LinkedIn: [jesseotremblay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesseotremblay/) *I don't use it for ongoing communication, I'd rather email.*
- Bluesky: [@jtrem.com](https://bsky.app/profile/jtrem.com) *It's...fine. Less hatefilled than Twitter. Less clunky than Mastodon. Still stupid, so I don't engage on it much.*
- Mastodon: [@jtrem@jtrem.me](https://jtrem.me/@jesse) *I check this less and less. The service is so clunky and few people I care to follow engage on it regualrly. So, I rarely check and engage.*
- Twitter: [@iamjtrem](https://twitter.com/iamjtrem) *I don't engage on it. Mainly use it to see what insane things are happening.*
- Threads: [@iamjtrem](https://www.threads.net/@iamjtrem) *I don't engage on it and almost never check it.*

To see what I'm focusing on, I have a [now page](https://jtrem.com/now).
