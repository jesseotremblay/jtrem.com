### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jesse

Here is how I prefer to keep in touch, and why:

- My favourite way to converse is [email](mailto:contact@jtrem.com).
- I mainly write on my website. To see what I'm focusing on, I have a now page.
- I use Substack to share my newsletter
- I have left Twitter or "X" and am glad to avoid it's hateful atmosphere
- I dislike LinkedIn as a platform, but use it to connect with work colleagues, and to keep an eye on the job market. I don't use it for ongoing communication, I'd rather email.
- I do use Instagram, but only on occasion, to connect with close friends and colleagues.
- I do not use Facebook or Threads.
- I am dabbling with BlueSky, we'll see if it's a keeper.
  This is an example of a Hello page. If you would like to make your own to encourage better communication, and share it with me, I would be happy to link to it.
