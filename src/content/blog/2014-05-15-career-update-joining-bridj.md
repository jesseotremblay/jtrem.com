I am really excited to join Bridj, [a prep-product startup looking to make mass transit smarter](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/04/10/data-driven-pop-bus-service-launch-boston/yz4EjzZC9nXnl22O6JcV2I/story.html). I'll be the first Product & UX person, but I'll also be playing an operational role to help it spin up it's service.
