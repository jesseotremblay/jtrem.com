I've been a runner for years now, and one of my favorite tools in that running journey has been [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/cms/).

Starting Monday, I'll get the change to work on the product directly as a Product Manager of the Run Experience Team.

Not only that, but I also get to work with some of the best Product People I've met. Can't wait to learn from them!
