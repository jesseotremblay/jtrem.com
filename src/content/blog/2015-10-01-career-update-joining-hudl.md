I am thrilled to announce that I am joining Hudl as a Product Manager in a few weeks. This decision excites me deeply, and I can't wait to share why this role feels like a perfect fit for me.

For many years, soccer has been a central part of my life. From playing the game, being a fan, to coaching, soccer has always been more than just a sport; it's a passion. My journey even led me to start a non-profit club team in Central Mass several years ago with a friend, a project that brought together dedicated young athletes and their supportive families who didn't have the means in the current pay-to-play American soccer environment. This experience has given me a firsthand understanding of the challenges and triumphs that come with youth sports.

Joining Hudl means stepping into a role where I can make a significant impact on youth sports, helping coaches and athletes achieve their best. Hudl's mission aligns perfectly with my personal passion for sports and my professional expertise. The platform Hudl provides is a game-changer, offering tools that empower coaches to analyze and improve performance, ultimately helping teams win more games.

As a Product Manager at Hudl, I am excited to bring my background in coaching and soccer to the table. I understand the needs of coaches and athletes because I've been in their shoes. My goal is to ensure that Hudl continues to evolve in ways that directly benefit the sports community. I look forward to collaborating with a team that shares my enthusiasm for sports and innovation.

This new chapter at Hudl is not just a job for me; it's an opportunity to contribute to a community that has given me so much joy and fulfillment. I am eager to help coaches and athletes succeed, just as I have experienced the joy of winning and the lessons of losing on the soccer field. Here's to a future filled with more victories, both on and off the field!
