Product managers chase quick wins. We shouldn't. Joshua Medcalf's "Chop Wood Carry Water" offers a different path. It's about the daily grind. The small steps. The process of getting better, bit by bit.

## The Journey Matters

We obsess over launches. User numbers. Adoption rates. But Medcalf says the real magic is in the journey. Every feature, feedback session, and bug fix is a step. Appreciate these steps. They're where growth happens.

## Akira's Story: Stick With It

Medcalf introduces Akira, a kid who wants to be a samurai archer. His journey teaches patience and persistence. Product managers need both.

Building great products isn't straightforward. There are detours. Roadblocks. But these aren't setbacks. They're chances to get stronger. A team that pushes through tough times becomes unstoppable.

## Master the Basics

"Chop wood, carry water" isn't just a phrase. It's about the mundane tasks that build greatness. For us, that's:

- **Market research**: Spend 30 minutes daily reading industry reports or analyzing competitor products. Keep a log of insights.
- **User interviews**: Conduct at least one user interview per week. Create a template for consistent questions and takeaways.
- **Data analysis**: Set up a weekly ritual to review key metrics. Create a simple dashboard for quick daily checks.

Not glamorous, but crucial.

It's tempting to chase shiny ideas. Don't. The next big thing is built on solid basics. Master them.

## Stay Focused

Mental discipline is key. Balance daily demands with long-term vision. Set clear priorities. Stick to them. Make time to think strategically. When you're committed to your vision, you can navigate the chaos.

## Obstacles Are Opportunities

Akira faces challenges. Each one teaches him something. We face our own hurdles:

1. **Market shifts**: Set up Google Alerts for your industry. Dedicate 15 minutes each morning to stay informed.
2. **Bad feedback**: Create a "feedback review" process. For every piece of negative feedback, identify one actionable improvement.
3. **Tech issues**: Establish a regular sync with your tech lead. Create a shared document to track and prioritize technical debt.

Don't see these as problems. See them as chances to improve.

Embrace failure. Learn from it. Iterate. This turns setbacks into stepping stones. It builds a culture of constant improvement.

## Be Present

Medcalf talks about being present. It's not just feel-good advice. It boosts productivity.

1. **Set focused work periods**: Use the Pomodoro technique. 25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break. Repeat.
2. **Cut distractions**: Turn off notifications during deep work sessions. Use apps like Freedom to block distracting websites.
3. **Reflect on your decisions**: End each day with a 5-minute journal entry. What worked? What didn't? What will you do differently tomorrow?

Are they aligned with your goals? Being present in every interaction leads to better choices.

## Consistency Wins

Consistency and persistence are Medcalf's foundation. For us, that means reliable processes. Stick to them. Be consistent in communication, execution, and follow-through. It builds trust.

- **Document decisions**: After every meeting, send a brief email summarizing key decisions and next steps.
- **Set clear expectations**: Use the RACI matrix for projects. Clarify who's Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.
- **Review progress often**: Set up weekly check-ins with your team. Use a simple red/yellow/green status update for each key initiative.

When things get tough, dig in. Pushing for your product's vision, even when it's hard, sets the tone for your team.

## Know Yourself

Medcalf emphasizes inner growth. For product managers, this means aligning actions with values. With your organization's mission. Be authentic. Have integrity.

Ask yourself:

> Are your decisions good for users? Are you building a positive team culture?

Staying true to your values inspires your team to do the same.

## The Long Game

"Chop Wood Carry Water" offers wisdom for product management:

- **Embrace the journey**: Celebrate small wins daily. Set up a "wins" channel in Slack where team members share their daily achievements, no matter how small.

- **Master the basics**: Dedicate time each week to refine fundamental skills. Schedule a recurring 30-minute slot for learning or practicing a core PM skill, like user story writing or prioritization techniques.

- **Stay disciplined**: Create and stick to a daily routine. Start each day by identifying your top 3 priorities and end it by reflecting on what you accomplished.

- **See challenges as opportunities**: Reframe setbacks in team meetings. When discussing a problem, always end with "What can we learn from this?" and document the insights.

- **Be present**: Practice active listening in every interaction. Put away devices during meetings and take handwritten notes to stay engaged.

- **Be consistent**: Establish and maintain regular check-ins with your team and stakeholders. Set up weekly 15-minute stand-ups with key team members to ensure alignment and progress.

Excellence isn't a sprint. It's a marathon. Commit to getting better every day. Understand your users. Apply these principles, and you'll build products that matter.
