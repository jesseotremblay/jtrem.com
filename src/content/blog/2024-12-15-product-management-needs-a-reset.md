There's a palpable tension in the product management community these days. Over the past year, I've had countless conversations with PMs, product leaders, and executives trying to understand why. A clear pattern has emerged: product management has lost its way.

Over the last decade, we've transformed from a role focused on building great products into one obsessed with process and optimization. The irony is striking – the very frameworks meant to make us faster and more effective have become rigid orthodoxy. "Lean startup," "agile," and "growth" methodologies have become chains rather than enablers, with PMs spending more time following their rules than remembering why these frameworks exist in the first place.

Brian Chesky recently captured this tension perfectly when he said "Technology might as well be a synonym for 'change'. We are in the change industry." He contrasted this with Tim Cook's tenure at Apple – excellent at scaling the iPhone, but not at creating transformative change. This distinction cuts to the heart of what's wrong with product management today.

We've become Tim Cooks in a world that needs Brian Cheskys. We've mastered the art of optimization and process, but lost sight of our real purpose: driving meaningful change through technology. Product managers should be agents of transformation, not custodians of the status quo. Instead, we've built careers around optimizing what exists rather than imagining what could be.

## Why Product Managers Exist

At its core, product management has a singular purpose: to inflect change in the world. This isn't about incremental improvements or process optimization. It's about creating fundamental shifts in how people work, live, and interact with technology.

Product managers exist to:
1. Solve problems with emerging technology in ways that drive outsized impact, not incremental improvement
2. Create solutions so delightful that people eagerly pay for them
3. Accelerate businesses not just toward revenue goals, but toward future market positions others haven't even imagined yet

When we lose sight of these fundamental purposes, we become process managers instead of product leaders. We optimize when we should transform. We facilitate when we should build.

## The Mindset Shift Product Management Needs

### From Optimizer to Accelerator
- Stop asking "How can we improve this?"
- Start asking "How can we fundamentally change this?"
- Focus on exponential possibilities, not incremental gains

### From Facilitator to Builder
- Less time managing processes
- More time actually building products
- Stop coordinating work and start creating value

### From Risk Mitigator to Risk Taker
- Embrace ambiguity as opportunity
- Make bold bets on future possibilities
- Value learning through failure over playing it safe

### From Metrics to Impact
- Stop optimizing for numbers
- Start optimizing for transformation
- Measure success by lives changed, not just metrics moved

### From Increments to Trajectories
- Think in terms of where technology is going
- Focus on future possibilities, not current limitations
- Build for tomorrow, not just today

### From Satisfier to Delighter
- Stop building adequate solutions
- Start creating experiences people love
- Make products so good people can't imagine going back

## What This Looks Like in Practice

### Embracing Emerging Technology
- Stay ahead of technological trends
- Experiment with new possibilities
- Find novel applications for emerging tech

### Building for Delight
- Focus on user joy, not just user needs
- Create experiences that surprise and delight
- Make the complex feel effortless

### Accelerating Business Success
- Think 10 steps ahead of the market
- Create new opportunities, don't just capture existing ones
- Drive transformation, not just optimization

## Making the Shift

For product managers ready to reclaim their role as agents of change:

1. **Audit Your Time**
   - How much time do you spend on process vs. building?
   - Are you leading change or managing status quo?
   - Where could you be taking bigger swings?

2. **Shift Your Questions**
   - Instead of "How can we improve this?"
   ask "How could we reinvent this?"
   - Instead of "What's the safe bet?"
   ask "What's the bold bet?"
   - Instead of "What's realistic?"
   ask "What's possible?"

3. **Change Your Impact**
   - Move from managing metrics to driving transformation
   - Focus on creating delight, not just satisfaction
   - Build for exponential change, not incremental improvement

## The Path Forward

Product management needs to return to its roots as a driver of change while embracing its future as an accelerator of transformation. This means:

- Being bold in our vision
- Being ambitious in our execution
- Being relentless in our pursuit of delight
- Being fearless in our embrace of change

The future belongs to product managers who can drive outsized impact through technological change. Not by following processes or optimizing metrics, but by imagining better futures and having the courage to build them.

It's time for product managers to stop being process optimizers and start being what we were meant to be: agents of transformation in the change industry.
