A few weeks ago I made the decision to join HubSpot as a Senior Product Manager. This move was not just a professional step forward but a personal alignment with a mission I deeply resonate with--solving problems for small businesses.

Before HubSpot, my career was built on a foundation of understanding and addressing the unique challenges that small businesses face. I've worked with many small businesses, and small early stage startups. My journey hasn't been just about building new products; it's also been about building empathy and understanding the struggles of running a small business. From limited resources to juggling multiple roles, I lived these challenges firsthand, which fueled my passion for creating impactful solutions.

When the opportunity at HubSpot came along, it felt like a natural progression. HubSpot's mission to help millions of organizations grow better resonated with my own professional ethos. HubSpot isn't just a tool; it's a lifeline for small businesses striving to thrive in a competitive landscape. The company's dedication to creating intuitive, powerful, and affordable solutions for marketing, sales, and customer service aligns perfectly with my belief that technology should be an enabler, not a barrier.

One of the most exciting aspects of joining HubSpot is the chance to work on products that I know will make a tangible difference in the day-to-day operations of small businesses. At HubSpot, we're not just developing features; we're crafting experiences that empower business owners to focus on what they do best.

Transitioning to HubSpot also means joining a community that thrives on innovation and collaboration. The culture there is one of continuous learning and support, where every team member's insight is valued. This collaborative spirit fuels their creativity and drives them to push boundaries, ensuring they deliver products that not only meet but exceed their users' expectations.

I'm inspired by the stories of small businesses using HubSpot to overcome challenges and achieve success. It's a reminder that the work goes beyond software--it's about empowering people and transforming businesses.
