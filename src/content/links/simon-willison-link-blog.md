Simon Willison discusses his approach to maintaining a link blog, including the tools and workflows he uses to discover and share interesting content. He covers everything from RSS feeds to bookmarklets, and how he balances curation with original commentary.

This is exactly the kind of thoughtful approach to link blogging that inspired the creation of this feature on my own site. The meta aspect of linking to a post about link blogging while implementing link blogging functionality is not lost on me.
