John Gruber's Daring Fireball has been the gold standard for link blogging for over two decades. His approach of sharing interesting links with thoughtful commentary while making the canonical link point to the original source has influenced countless bloggers and shaped how we think about content curation on the web.

What makes Gruber's approach so effective is the balance between curation and commentary. He doesn't just share linksâ€”he adds context, analysis, and often his own unique perspective that makes the shared content more valuable than it would be on its own.

This link post feature is directly inspired by that format, bringing the same philosophy to modern static site generation while maintaining the technical benefits of having your own site as the hub for your curation.
